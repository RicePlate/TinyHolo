Goal: Create a cursor from scratch that follows my gaze.

Dependencies/Questions:
    1. Raycast (and using the Physics API)
    2. Gaze manager? Is this necessary? Seems like just a wrapper on Camera.main
    3. How do I make a cursor that conforms to my already mapped surroundings?

Part 1: Setup
------------- 
(assumes familiarity with the tutorials)

0. clone, and follow directions for importing HoloToolkit
1. setup project player + quality (Edit -> Project Settings -> Player... you know the drill)
   - remove Main Camera and Directional Light
   - What's "Use 16-bit Depth Buffers" and should I select it?
2. grab Main Camera asset from holotoolkit -> Utilities -> Prefabs -> Main Camera  (ooh what's this FPSDisplay?)
3. save scene as (ctrl+s) New Folder -> "Scenes" -> Scenes/Cursor101
4. Build and deploy to device (should just see the unity intro screen and then nothingness)

16-bit Depth Buffers
--------------------
TODO: (something to do with depth of the scene, shadow effects (aka ambient occlusion)
      it's quickly down the rabbithole here with understanding Depth Textures, what scene depth is,
      what about if my scene has no directional light? what if there's a shader that supports lighting?
      will i be able to see it? way too much info for just initial exploration (way too tangential).

-> don't select for now, until I can understand its effects more fully



Part 2: Create Cursor
---------------------
1. Create a new game object and rename it "MyCursor"
2.
