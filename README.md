Mini Hololens Projects


This space is intended for personal progress tracking.

I am a noob developer in Windows (and CLR, heh, but I know what CLR is!), and Unity.
I have been through the helpful materials provided by HoloAcademy, but I wanted to
take a more paired-down approach.

1. Unity Personal Edition (64bit) 5.4.0b24-HTP

    Version 5.4.0b24-HTP (e3e057da3607) Personal
